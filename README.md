# MinWPFProgram

This is an excercise to create minimized "Hello, World!" programs for WFP on .NET 5, one is pure XAML and the other is pure C# code.
From the skeleton project created by dotnet command, we learn how XAML and code-behind are related and interchangeable. We also try to trim down anything we don't abolutely needed to run the programs.
